### Mappers

The following mappers have been implemented:

* NROM (0)
* MMC1 (1)
* UNROM (2)
* MMC3 (4)

These mappers cover about 75% of all NES games. I hope to implement more
mappers soon. To see what games should work, consult this list:

### Known Issues

* the APU DMC channel is not yet implemented
* there are some minor issues with PPU timing, but most games work OK anyway
* some games just show a black screen, not sure why yet
